# ME 405 Lab 4
The objective of this lab is to control two motors simultaneously using a task function. The first part is to identify the  slowest rate at which the performance is not significantly worse than when running the controller at a fast rate. We determined that the best run was at a rate of 30ms. We at first tried at a rate of 50ms but it turned out not great for an appropriate run for our motor. We then took it down to 40ms and it gave us a better plot. Therefore we determined 30ms to be the best rate. 
The next part  of the lab was to use an example of a task function and modify it by having it run two separate motors simultaneously, either with the same or different rates.
